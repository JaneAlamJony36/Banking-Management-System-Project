# 🏦 Banking Management System (Java Console App)

This is a simple *Java-based banking management system* that demonstrates all the core *Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)* principles through a console application. Users can perform various operations on a bank account like creating, updating, deleting, depositing, withdrawing, and viewing details — all while following clean OOP design patterns.

## 📌 OOP Concepts Used

| Concept        | Applied Through |
|----------------|------------------|
| *Abstraction*    | BankAccount abstract class with abstract method withdraw() |
| *Encapsulation*  | Private/protected fields with getters/setters (holderName, balance, etc.) |
| *Inheritance*    | CurrentAccount inherits from BankAccount |
| *Polymorphism*   | Abstract reference to subclass instance + method overriding (withdraw) |
